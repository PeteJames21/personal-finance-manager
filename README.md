Personal Finance Tracker is a tool used to track personal finances. The application allows a user to register an account, sign in, and create transactions. Once a user signs up and logs in, a default profile of 'personal' is created. Profiles allow the user to separate concerns. For instance, one can use a personal profile to track personal transactions, a work profile to track work-related transactions, or a charity profile to track transactions for a charity group. This feature allows the user to separate various monies into neat and separate places, allowing for easier accounting.

Within each profile, the user has to create an account. Accounts represent the containers that hold various monies. For instance, one can have a 'cash' account to store cash at hand, 'Mpesa' to represent money on an Mpesa account, or 'Bank 1' to store money in bank account 1.

Once accounts are created, the user can easily add transactions as they see fit.

There are three types of transactions a user can do:
1. Income
2. Expense
3. Transfer

The transaction form is responsive and will display the required fields for either of the three transactions.

The dashboard on the home page offers a summary of a user's transactions. It shows the top 5 incomes and expenses, as well as the net income and average daily expenditure.

Below that, helpful visualizations are provided which portray the information in visually appealing visuals. The income and expense pages provide a detailed overview of each type of transaction. The balance page provides the current balance for each account.
